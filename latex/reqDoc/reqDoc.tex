\section{INTRODUCTION}

This section will provide an overview of what is included in this Software 
Requirements Document (SRS).

\subsection{Purpose}

This SRS document will serve several purposes. First it will define the 
requirements for the "UniversityGear" application that team "4Credit"
 will be developing for their CS Capstone project for eBay. The 
document will be detailing the constraints, features, dependencies and performance 
of the application in a manner that clearly demonstrates what the client will be
 receiving.The intended audience for this Software Requirements Specification 
(SRS) will be the team, eBay, and the instructors of the computer science senior
 capstone class at Oregon State University. 

\subsection{Scope}

The Android Application, "UniversityGear", will allow users to browse and 
shop for college merchandise that are for sale through eBay. The application 
will be published to the Google Play Store and will be optimized for Android's 
latest operating system 'N'. \newline

This application will also demonstrate the use and functionality of eBay's 
public APIs by allowing users to search eBay's inventory of items. The 
application will allow users to filter out their search results by different 
criteria. The application will also allow users to purchase items from eBay.

\subsection{Overview}

The remainder of this document will provide an overview of the functionality 
that the "UniversityGear" application will offer along with the 
interaction that it will have with other systems. The next chapter will identify
 any constraints that may prevent success for this project.

\section{OVERALL DESCRIPTION}

This section will provide the reader with an overview of the entire application.
 The application will be explained in a way that the functionality is easily 
identified along with any constraints.

\subsection{Product Perspective}

The android application will communicate with eBay to provide the user with the 
opportunity to shop through their inventory of college related merchandise. The 
communication will be accomplished with the use of eBay's APIs. This 
communication is important to provide the user with a seamless shopping 
experience without having to switch between different applications.\newline

Since no data regarding the inventory of items that eBay provides will be stored
 by this application, there will be a constant need for an Internet connection 
to be able to pull search results from eBay's inventory. 

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

The user interface will mimic what people already know about eBay and other 
similar shopping experiences. This will include standard things such as a place 
to search for items, and a place to view items. Searching 
could also vary depending on search settings like a basic search or advanced 
searching. When viewing items, there could be several kinds of list views. We 
would also have specific college-related images to help users to find the item 
that they are looking for. Since our application is limited to college 
merchandises, we will have some visual appeals that reflect what the application
 is about.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

The devices that we use must be compatible with M and N os. 

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

We will be using the new Android operating system, N. We will also be making use
 of a wide variety of eBay's new APIs. Some of these are apart of their new Buy 
APIs. These ones include the Browse and Order APIs. The Browse API will allow us
 to search for items and find different item feeds. The Order API will allow us 
to have some form of item checkout and order tracking. Together, these APIs
 will allow us to connect with eBay's large collection of items. We also plan 
on using their Guest Checkout API, so that users will be able to purchase items.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}

The device should always have some form of connection to the internet. This 
means the device can connect in one of two ways. The first being through the 
devices WLAN. The second being that it could connect using its cellular data.

\subsubsection{Operations}

There will be many user initiated operations. These include searching and 
purchasing. Searching means that the user will be finding items with specific 
search criteria. The items that they find could be related to different schools,
 or have specific colors. Purchasing means that the user is able to select an 
item that they want and pay for it.\newline

The application should only be in use when a user is actually using it. There 
are no periods of unattended use. The only time that might be considered as 
unattended use, is when the application is gathering and displaying search 
results to the user. 

\subsection{Production Functions}

There are a couple of major features that this application will support. It will
 allow for users to search for items and to purchase them. Users will be able 
to browse eBay's large collection of college merchandise that they have for 
sale. The application will allow users to narrow down what they are looking for 
by allowing them to use filters such as types of items, condition, cost, college
 specific, by terms, and so on. \newline

The results of these searches will be displayed in either a listview that simply
 provides minor details regarding the item or thumbnail views that provide an 
image of the product along with a few details. The number of results displayed 
at once will vary depending on how the user wants the results presented to them 
and by the screen size of the product that they will be using. The application 
will also allow the user to sort the order in which the items are displayed. The
 sort options will be similar to what eBay provides on their current website. 
This includes sorting by price or condition.

\subsection{User Characteristics}

Users will include individuals who are looking to find great deals on college 
merchandise online. The typical user will be someone who is looking for college 
merchandise. The actual user group could range between many different people. 
The main audience should be individuals looking for college merchandise and 
could be incoming college students, or people who are already college students. 
Users could also be parents, grandparents or other individuals who are looking 
to help out a relative or friend in searching for any college merchandise that 
the individual might need. \newline

Since are users are going to use this application on  a mobile device, 
our main focus to the user would be to create an interface that is simple
 and straightforward. The user should be able to learn and familiarize with the interface
 in a short period of time. Furthermore, the processes should be fast; the 
window between processes should be short to keep the attention of the users.

\subsection{Constraints}

Android's new operating system, N OS, will be the biggest constraint. This is 
because the operating system is new and is not present on many of today's top 
Android devices. This also means that the documentation may not be up to date 
with the new operating system. Older APIs created by Google may also be
 deprecated.\newline

Large loads on the application might put strain on lower quality machines. 
Example of large loads would be a lot of activities and threads and overly 
large image.Testing might also be a constraint since a virtual machine will take a huge 
amount of computer resources. For a better testing environment, the usage of an 
actual physical smartphone might be needed.

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependancies}

An assumption and dependency for this project will be the availability of the 
Android operating system N and a device that can run it. A secondary assumption 
is that the mobile phone which the application will be running on will have an 
active internet connection. A third assumption would be that users of the 
application will have an eBay account that they will be able to use to save 
searched items and even checkout and complete a purchase through the 
application. A dependency that the application will have is that we highly 
depends on the connection to the eBay database. If the database server is down, 
we might not get the app to work.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

This section will define how are application will meet the software system 
attributes.

\subsubsection{Reliability}

The application should be able to search and purchase items according to what 
has been specified by the user. We also make sure that our application will 
have a high crash free rate. We will also make sure that our application doesn't
 have any memory or activity leaks.

\subsubsection{Availability}

The application will be available only to users who have Android devices. These 
users must also have devices that are compatible with the new operating system, 
N and the current operating system, M. Other than the two constraints above, 
any user who has a valid internet connection and access to the United 
States Google Play store, should be able to download and use our application.

\subsubsection{Security}

Security should not be a problem, as the APIs are using HTTPS protocols for 
receiving and sending data. On top of that, we will be using the Android 
Keystore to secure any developer tokens we need to use.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

In order to create an application that is easily maintainable, we must be sure 
that all the parts are separated in an easy to manage fashion. We would avoid 
over-coupling objects and classes and use an MVC design pattern. Our code 
will also be testable, readable, and commented well.

\subsubsection{Portability}

We acknowledge the fact that our application will not be very portable. This is 
because we a specifically developing the application for Android systems. This 
means that our language is also going to be in Java.
